============

Rambling Man is a simple algorithm developed for the Brilliant.org Hunger games in August 2013.
The contest was a game theory/programming challenge in which participants created robots that
chose to either hunt or slack against each other to earn "food". The objectives were (1) to survive
for the entire competition, which meant avoiding hitting 0 food, and (2) to have the highest remaining
stockpile of food at the end of the competition

Out of over 300 participants, 50 of whom "survived" for the duration of the contest, mine finished
in 16th place! I'm pretty excited about this result because my algorithm wasn't even super complex.
To learn about the algorithm itself and the reasoning behind it, see the file "Logic_Analysis.txt".
